Hi there ^^,

Overall: This project is where I analyze data about nobel prize winners through multiple demographics and use some graphs to depict those interesting insights!

Technology: Google Colab (Python), Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, plotply)

Structure: all the project is in 1 file (Nobel_Prize_Analysis_(start).ipynb) in the same rep.
